This repo is intended to be used as a template for future Women TechMakers (WTM) events as landing page. Thanks to [GDG CÃ³rdoba]() for sharing it with us :)

UPDATE: seems the work on this repo has been done over the compiled files, so the `_src` directory is not really being used.

To update it, just clone it and edit the files inside the `dist` folder.

You can serve the `dist` folder locally to get a local preview.
